## General Information

Multiple linear regression is performed on the dataset.
The project is done as part of coursework in the Machine Learning module.
We are trying to find the number of rentals issued from the company based on numerous independent values such as temperature, weather, humidity, holiday, etc.
The Boombikes bike rental dataset is being used



## Conclusions

The R-squared value of the train set is 82.71% whereas the test set has a value of 81.13% which suggests that our model broadly explains the variance quite accurately on the test set and thus we can conclude that it is a good model.

Our developed model's mean squared error is almost 0 on both the training and testing datasets which suggests that the variance is accurately predicted on the test set. The p-values and VIF were used to select the significant variables. RFE was also conducted for automated selection of variables.

The major steps included in the python notebook are data interpretation, data visualisation, data pre-processing, model training, feature selection, residual analysis, model evaluation on the test set.

Concepts such as EDA, p-value, VIF, RFE were used and model building was done using statsmodels library
